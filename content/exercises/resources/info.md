On this page, you can find the exercise sheets for the work groups.

Exercise sheets for sessions currently under development are locked. They will
be unlocked in time for the tutorial.

Each section has a set of exercises that you'll go through with your TA in the
session. 

You'll receive constructive feedback from your TA on your work. 

You can also ask your TA for suggestions and advice.

You **must** show your work in order to get tips, meaning that if you just
say "i don't know". Try by yourself first and explain _what_ you don't get.

The questions marked with a 
{{< i class="bi bi-lightbulb-fill" >}}
{{< /i >}}
have solutions available online. The solutions are
password protected and you'll receive the password in the work groups.
