On this page, you can find the exercise sheets for the work groups.

Each section has a set of exercises that you'll go through with your TA in the
session. 

Some exercises are marked as homework, they are due at the beginning of the
next session. 

You'll receive constructive feedback from your TA on your work. 

You can also ask your TA for suggestions and advice.

You **must** show your work in order to get tips, meaning that if you just
say "i don't know". Try by yourself first and explain _what_ you don't get.
