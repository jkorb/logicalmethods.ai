# Proofs

In this chapter, you'll learn about **proof systems**, an important
logical tool for automated reasoning. Remember from {{< chapter_ref chapter="valid-inference" id="logical-systems">}}
Chapter 2. Logic and AI {{< /chapter_ref >}}, that logical systems typically have three components: syntax, semantics, and proof theory. Since we've covered syntax in 
{{< chapter_ref chapter="formal-languages" >}}
Chapter 3. Formal languages {{< /chapter_ref >}}
and semantics in 
{{< chapter_ref chapter="boolean" >}} Chapter 4. Boolean algebra {{< /chapter_ref >}}, 
after this chapter, you'll have seen all the components of logical systems.

First, we'll go through the [ideas](#ideas), after which we'll cover two of the most important examples of [proof systems](#proof-systems): 

+ [Hilbert systems](#hilbert-systems), and
+ [natural deduction](#natural-deduction).

Finally, you'll learn about applications of proof systems. Specifically:

+ [metalogic](#metalogic),
+ [proof assistants](#proof-verification),
+ [automated theorem proving](#automated-theorem-provers).

## Ideas

Proofs are models of step-wise inference. Think, for example, of the following
inference:

+ Ada is either in the study or on the Philosopher's Walk, and if she's on the
Philosopher's Walk, she's thinking about mathematics. Ada is not in the study,
so she must be thinking about mathematics.

While the inference _is_ deductively valid, it is rather difficult to see this
immediately. It helps to split this up into a step-wise argument:

1. Ada is either in the study or on the Philosopher's Walk. (Assumption)
2. Ada is not in the study. (Assumption)
3. Ada is on the Philosopher's Walk (1.,2. via Disjunctive Syllogism)
4. If Ada is on the Philosopher's Walk, then she's thinking about mathematics.
   (Assumption)
5. Ada is thinking about mathematics. (3.,4. via Modus Ponens)

After each line, we write in parentheses a justification for the line: either
it's an assumption or something we've derived from other lines via a valid
inference pattern. Proofs are a **mathematical model** of this kind of step-wise
inference.

A **(formal) proof** is a sequence of formulas, where each formula either (i) is
an assumption or known to be true or (ii) derives from the previous formulas in
proof via **inference rules**. The final formula of a proof is the
**conclusion**.

An **inference rule** is a rule that sanctions an inference from assumptions
$A_1,\dots,A_n$ to a conclusion $C$. Typically, we write this in the following
form: 

$$\\begin{array}{ccc} A_1 & \dots  & A_n \\\\ \\hline & C \\end{array}$$

But there are also other notations, such as $A_1,A_2,\dots$/$C$ or
$A_1,A_2,\dots\vdash C$, for example.


We write: $$A_1, A_2, \dots\vdash C$$ to say that there exists a formal proof
with assumptions $A_1, A_2,\dots$ and conclusion $C$.

As we'll see, there are many different proof systems even for just classical
propositional logic. We typically clarify which system we mean by subscripting
the $\vdash$ like so: $$A_1, A_2, \dots\vdash_\mathbf{S} C$$

Fully formalized, the above argument then becomes something like this:

$$\mathsf{STUDY}\lor\mathsf{WALK},\mathsf{WALK}\to\mathsf{MATH},\neg\mathsf{STUDY}\vdash\mathsf{MATH}$$

We can visually represent the corresponding proof as follows:

{{< img src="img/inference1.png" class="img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block my-4" >}}

Next, we'll go through the most important examples of different kinds of proof
systems.

## Proof systems

There are many different kinds of [proof
systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_calculus), here we'll go through
the most important examples from the perspective of logical theory.

### Hilbert systems

**Hilbert systems** are traditionally the most common kinds of proof systems.
They are modelled after mathematical [axiomatic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system), where we aim to derive all relevant truths from a limited number of basic truths or **axioms**. All axioms are treated as known facts.

Typically, Hilbert systems have few inference rules, sometimes as few as just
one.

Here's an example of a Hilbert system for propositional logic.

1. All formulas of the following form are axioms:

 $$ A\to ( B\to A)\tag{Axiom 1.}$$

 $$( A\to ( B\to C))\to(( A\to B)\to ( A\to C))\tag{Axiom 2.}$$

 $$(\neg  A\to \neg  B)\to ( B\to A)\tag{Axiom 3.}$$

2. The only inference rule is **MP**: $A,A\to B\vdash B$

Note that this system only uses $\to,\neg$ as its only connectives. 

But there's a "trick" to deal with the other connectives. Using the following
rewriting rules, we can rewrite every formula equivalently using only $\neg$ and
$\land$:

$$( A\land B)\leadsto \neg( A\to\neg B)$$
$$( A\lor B)\leadsto(\neg A\to B)$$ 
$$( A\leftrightarrow B)\leadsto(( A\to B)\land( B\to A))$$

This works just like the rewriting into {{< chapter_ref chapter="sat" id="cnf" >}}CNF{{< /chapter_ref >}}.

Here's how derivations work in a Hilbert system. We show that $\vdash \mathsf{RAIN}\to \mathsf{RAIN}$ , i.e. we can derive the logical truth $\mathsf{RAIN}\to \mathsf{RAIN}$ (if it rains, it rains) from the axioms only:

1. $((\mathsf{RAIN} \to ((\mathsf{RAIN} \to \mathsf{RAIN}) \to \mathsf{RAIN})) \to ((\mathsf{RAIN} \to (\mathsf{RAIN} \to \mathsf{RAIN})) \to (\mathsf{RAIN} \to \mathsf{RAIN})))$ 

    (Axiom 2. with $A=\mathsf{RAIN}, B=(\mathsf{RAIN}\to \mathsf{RAIN}),$ and $C=\mathsf{RAIN}$)

2. $(\mathsf{RAIN} \to ((\mathsf{RAIN} \to \mathsf{RAIN}) \to \mathsf{RAIN}))$ 

    (Axiom 1. with $A=\mathsf{RAIN}$ and $B=(\mathsf{RAIN}\to \mathsf{RAIN})$)

3. $((\mathsf{RAIN} \to (\mathsf{RAIN} \to \mathsf{RAIN})) \to (\mathsf{RAIN} \to \mathsf{RAIN}))$ 

    (From 1. and 2. by MP.)

4. $(\mathsf{RAIN} \to (\mathsf{RAIN} \to \mathsf{RAIN}))$ 

    (Axiom 1. with $A=\mathsf{RAIN}$ and $B=\mathsf{RAIN}$.)

5. $(\mathsf{RAIN} \to \mathsf{RAIN})$

    (From 3. and 4. by MP.)

It is far from easy to find derivations like this. It is hard to learn for both
humans and machines. On the upside, Hilbert systems are economical from a
mathematical perspective. They are easy to define and to investigate, making
them ideal for [metalogical](#metalogic) applications.

But Hilbert systems also have practical use. They are _relatively_ easy to apply when assumptions are involved and we translate the formulas in question using the re-writing rules mentioned above. 

Let's look at a Hilbert-style proof for: 
$$\mathsf{STUDY}\lor\mathsf{WALK},\mathsf{WALK}\to\mathsf{MATH},\neg\mathsf{STUDY}\vdash\mathsf{MATH}$$

First, we need to rewrite $\mathsf{STUDY}\lor\mathsf{WALK}$ using the rules to
$\neg \mathsf{STUDY}\to\mathsf{WALK}$. So, what we really show is:
$$\neg\mathsf{STUDY}\to\mathsf{WALK},\mathsf{WALK}\to\mathsf{MATH},\neg\mathsf{STUDY}\vdash\mathsf{MATH}$$
We get:

1. $\neg \mathsf{STUDY}\to\mathsf{WALK}$ (Assumption)
2. $\neg \mathsf{STUDY}$ (Assumption)
3. $\mathsf{WALK}$ (1.,2. MP)
4. $\mathsf{WALK}\to\mathsf{MATH}$ (Assumption)
5. $\mathsf{MATH}$ (3.,4. MP)

This is a pretty straight-forward derivation, just using MP twice. One way of looking at it is that the chaining algorithms we discussed in {{< chapter_ref
chapter="conditionals" id="cnf" >}}Chapter 6. Conditionals{{< /chapter_ref >}} are essentially an effective way of finding Hilbert-style proofs from the knowledge base.

### Natural deduction

**Natural deduction** systems solve the problem of being difficult to learn for
humans. They are intended to mimic the actual step-by-step derivations we make
"in our heads".

Natural deduction systems have **no axioms**, they are entirely **rule-based**.
The standard system for classical propositional logic, for example, looks like
this:

{{< img src="img/nd.png" class="img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block my-4" >}}

These rules need some explanation: 

The symbol $\bot$ is a logical symbol that stands for a logical contradiction.
It has some special rules but otherwise, it works just like any other
propositional variable.

In natural deduction, you can always introduce new assumptions to your proof by
simply using them in an inference rule. The crucial thing is that you can
**discharge** assumptions, as in the rule for $\to I$:

$$\\begin{array}{ccc} [A] \\\\ \vdots  \\\\ B \\\\ \\hline A\to B \\end{array}$$

What this rule says is that if you have a derivation of $B$ from $A$ using the
rules of natural deduction, you can treat the assumption $A$ as _discharged_ and it no longer counts as an assumption. 

This is, for example, how we would derive the logical truth
$\neg(\mathsf{RAIN}\land\neg\mathsf{RAIN})$ (it's not both raining and not raining): 

{{< img src="img/non-contradiction.png" class="img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block my-4" >}}

So, we get $\vdash\neg(\mathsf{RAIN}\land\neg\mathsf{RAIN})$ Note that there are no assumptions in this claim. The assumption that we made (twice!) that $\mathsf{RAIN}\land\neg\mathsf{RAIN}$ was discharged by the application of $\neg I$ at the end. 

Here's the derivation to for our running example:

{{< img src="img/inference1-nd.png" class="img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block my-4" >}}

Note that while there are two assumptions that aren't among our premises, $\mathsf{STUDY}$ and $\mathsf{WALK}$, both are discharged. So, this shows that:

$$\mathsf{STUDY}\lor\mathsf{WALK},\mathsf{WALK}\to\mathsf{MATH},\neg\mathsf{STUDY}\vdash\mathsf{MATH}$$

There are many, many different equivalent [natural deduction
systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction) for writing natural
deduction proofs. The notation we're using here is called [Prawitz-style
natural deduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dag_Prawitz).

Since the rule $\to E$ is essentially also just MP, we can use chaining algorithms with natural deduction as well.

### Resolution-based systems

These are just the most commonly used kind of systems in logical theory. But
there are way [more different kinds of
systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_proof_system), where especially [sequent calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus) is of special theoretical importance. 

But in the context of logic and AI, we should mention that the resolution
algorithm (as well as DPLL), which we studied in the exercises for {{<
chapter_ref chapter="conditionals" id="cnf" >}}Chapter 6{{< /chapter_ref >}},
is, essentially, also a proof system. 

Remember that the resolution rule, in its most general form, states that if you
have two clauses ($l_i,k_j$ are literals)

$$l_1\lor l_2\lor \dots\lor p \qquad \qquad \neg p\lor k_1\lor k_2\lor\dots$$

you can infer: 

$$l_1\lor l_2\lor \dots k_1\lor k_2\lor\dots$$

In rule form, we can thus write this as:

$$\\begin{array}{ccc} l_1\lor l_2\lor \dots\lor p & & \neg p\lor k_1\lor
k_2\lor\dots  \\\\ \\hline & l_1\lor l_2\lor \dots k_1\lor k_2\lor\dots
\\end{array}$$

Written as a rule like this, for formula-formula inferences rather than working with sets of literals, we need to answer one question: _What happens if $p$ and $\neg p$ are the only members of their respective clauses_? That is, what happens if we have:

$$\\begin{array}{ccc} p & & \neg p  \\\\ \\hline & ? \\end{array}$$

The answer seems to be obvious: in this case, we've arrived at a contradiction. So, $?$ should be $\bot$.

The resolution rule in this sense is **sound**: if the premises are true, then
so is the conclusion. In other words, the rule corresponds to a valid inference. 

We can, for example, use the resolution rule to check the validity of our
running example: 
$$\mathsf{STUDY}\lor\mathsf{WALK},\mathsf{WALK}\to\mathsf{MATH},\neg\mathsf{STUDY}\vdash\mathsf{MATH}$$
First, we need to use CNF re-writing and equivalently rewrite
$\mathsf{WALK}\to\mathsf{MATH}$ as $\neg\mathsf{WALK}\lor\mathsf{MATH}$. Then we can apply resolution as follows:

{{< img src="img/resolution.png" class="img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block my-4" >}}

But the resolution rule _alone_ doesn't give us an adequate proof system. To
see this, note that we can never derive a _more complex_ formula from a simpler
formula using resolution. Take for example the valid inference
$\mathsf{RAIN}\vDash\mathsf{RAIN}\lor\mathsf{SNOW}$. There is no way to apply
the resolution rule to get the conclusion, $\mathsf{RAIN}\lor\mathsf{SNOW}$,
from the premise $\mathsf{RAIN}$. To do so, we need to widen our concept of a
proof.

So far, we've looked at proofs as derivations of formulas from formulas by
means of a step-wise arguments. This was a mathematical model of what we might
call "direct inference". 

To understand resolution-based systems as proof systems, we need to widen that
perspective somewhat: we need to think of a proof as a formal procedure that
establishes a valid inference between premises and conclusion: 

+ A proof for $A_1,A_2,\dots\vdash C$ in a resolution-based system is a
derivation of $\bot$ from the clauses of the CNF's of $A_1,A_2,\dots, \neg C$. 

This is essentially the idea that we used in the resolution (and DPLL)
algorithm, just expressed as a formal proof system: we show that it's logically
impossible to make the premises true and the conclusion false. 

In the resulting system, then, we _can_ prove
$\mathsf{RAIN}\vDash\mathsf{RAIN}\lor\mathsf{SNOW}$. First, we need to determine
the CNF of $\neg(\mathsf{RAIN}\lor\mathsf{SNOW})$, which is just
$\neg\mathsf{RAIN}\land\neg\mathsf{SNOW}$. The clauses are therefore
$\neg\mathsf{RAIN}$ and $\neg\mathsf{SNOW}$. So, what we need to find is a
derivation of $\bot$ from the clauses
$\mathsf{RAIN},\neg\mathsf{RAIN},\mathsf{SNOW}$. But that's just an immediate
application of the resolution rule to the first two clauses:

$$\\begin{array}{ccc} \mathsf{RAIN} & & \neg \mathsf{RAIN}  \\\\ \\hline & \bot \\end{array}$$

This shows that in the resolution-based proof system, we get:
$$\mathsf{RAIN}\vdash\mathsf{RAIN}\lor\mathsf{SNOW}$$

## Applications

The applications of proof systems in science and technology is great. But for
AI-purposes, we should highlight at least the following three:

### Metalogic

A running theme of the course is the foundational role of logic in AI research:
we're studying valid inference as paradigm intelligent behavior. Proof systems
play an important part in this perspective on logic as AI.

The reason for this is that proof systems essentially provide is with a
computationally tractable model of step-wise inference: proof systems are
precisely defined in finite terms that are easy™️ to implement.

This perspective motivates an interest for AI researchers into metalogical
results, especially the so-called soundness and completeness theorems. A proof
system is called **sound** if in the system, only things that actually follow
can be derived:

$$P_1,P_2,\dots\vdash C\Rightarrow P_1,P_2,\dots\vDash C$$

This is a sort of "sanity check" for a proof system. A system that doesn't
satisfy soundness, is for obvious reasons not very useful.

Conversely, a system is called **complete** if in the system _all_ consequences
can be derived:

$$P_1,P_2,\dots\vDash C\Rightarrow P_1,P_2,\dots\vdash C$$

Completeness, in contrast to soundness, is _not_ easy to obtain. A complete
proof system can derive _all_ consequences, the ones we've thought of and the
ones we haven't. This is quite a feat.

A milestone result in metalogical research were the soundness and completeness
theorems proved by [Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del)
and others. A special case of this result is that the systems we've discussed in
this chapter are sound and complete with respect to the Boolean algebra
semantics:

+ **Soundness and completeness theorem**: In propositional logic, we have 

    $$P_1,P_2,\dots\vDash C\Leftrightarrow P_1,P_2,\dots\vdash C$$

  where $\vdash$ denotes derivability in our Hilbert, natural deduction, or
  resolution system. 

A sound and complete system gives an precise characterization of logical
consequence in a step-wise computable fashion.

### Proof verification

Going more in a practical direction, **proof verification** is a core
application of proof systems in AI. Here, we're talking about AI in a broader
sense, where we're "outsourcing" intelligent behavior to a computational model.
The aim of proof verification is to take mathematical arguments in natural
language, calculations and proofs alike, and _verify_ them by showing their
validity in a logical proof system. 

A **proof assistant** or **interactive theorem prover** is a computer program
that interactively checks formal arguments provided in a formal language. To
illustrate, here are the proofs of our Hilbert $Axioms_{1--3}$ in the
interactive theorem prover [Lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant)):

{{< img src="img/lean.png" class="img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block my-4" >}}

As you can see, Lean works very much like a programming language with an
[interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) running "on
the side". In the interpreter window, you can see whether the proof that you've
so-far is correct. 

What's important to understand is that interactive theorem provers help us to
drastically reduce the **epistemic burden** on checking for correctness of
mathematical proofs and complex calculations: any correct mathematical argument
can be verified in theorem provers like Lean, so the question of whether a given
proof is correct reduces to the question whether the theorem prover used to
verify it is correct. We no longer need to check each proof individually, we
just need to check the verifier itself.

There is a wide range of proof assistants on the market such as:

+ [Lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant))
+ [Isabelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelle_(proof_assistant))
+ [Coq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq_(software))

The project of formally verifying mathematical results is a very undertaking in
current research, which has yielded impressive results like, [Lean's ```mathlib```](https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html), and is actively pursued by leading research mathematicians, like [Terence Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao).

### Automated theorem provers

The final application we should briefly mention is **automated reasoning**.
We've already seen some automated reasoning methods, such as satisfiability
checking in the context of planning. **Automated theorem proving** takes another
perspective on automated reasoning: it aims to automate _mathematical proofs_.

A particularly exciting instance of automated reasoning is **neural theorem
proving**, which is a combination of logic-based methods, like interactive
theorem provers, and modern sub-symbolic methods. The idea is to train neural
networks how to use interactive theorem provers, like Lean. This project has
been fairly successful so far and has lead to AI's that can solve problems from
the [mathematics Olympiad](https://openai.com/index/formal-math/).
