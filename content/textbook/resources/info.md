This is the course's textbook, where each chapter roughly corresponds to a
lecture. 

I expect students to have read the chapter before the lecture.

It is also a good idea to review the chapter again _after_ the lecture. 

**Reminder!**

Keep in mind that your education is in your own hands: what you get out of the
course is commensurate to what you put in. Put in the work!

Here are some suggestions:

+ Read as many times as necessary, don't just skim the text once.

+ If you don't understand, use additional resources. Google, Wikipedia, other
textbooks, ...

+ If you still don't understand something, ask! In the lecture, in the work groups,
your fellow students, ... We're in this together.
