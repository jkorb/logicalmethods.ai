This page containes the material for the course [Logical methods for
AI](https://osiris-student.uu.nl/onderwijscatalogus/extern/cursus?cursuscode=KI1V24001&taal=nl&collegejaar=2024)
as taught at [Utrecht
University](https://www.uu.nl/bachelors/kunstmatige-intelligentie").

Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to understand, artificially replicate, and
possibly improve intelligent behavior. In this course, you will learn about the
role that logic plays in this pursuit. Logic is the study of correct reasoning:
what constitutes good and bad inferences. Because reasoning is a fundamental
aspect of intelligent behavior, logic is a core subject in AI research. You
will learn how the methods of modern logic have influenced the development of
AI as a discipline and the role they play in current and cutting-edge AI
research, for example in the context of recent developments surrounding GenAI.

This course teaches you the logical foundations of AI research. At the end, you
will be able to:
+ identify the applications of logic within AI,
+ explain the strengths and weaknesses of logic within AI,
+ represent knowledge using logical formulas,
+ apply algorithms for automated reasoning, and
+ evaluate inferences in AI contexts for validity.


The material is intended for students taking the course, but it's freely
available to anyone interested.

###### Instructions!
