# 1. Introduction 

[↑Return to top](./#toc)

The **Tutoraat KI Basis** is our program's 'academic support system' for
first-year students. Each freshman is assigned a **tutor**: a faculty member
who supports them during their first year and serves as their main point of
contact with our program.

Each tutor oversees about 25 students, forming a **tutor group**. This group is
the students' 'academic home' within the program. For example, students take
many seminars and work groups together as a tutor group throughout the year.

Each tutor is supported by a team of two **mentors** and two **peer coaches**.
These are experienced students who bring a student perspective to the program.
Mentors and peer coaches have different roles: mentors focus on the social
aspects of the program, while peer coaches provide academic support and help
with developing academic skills.

We organize various activities throughout the academic year. This guideline
outlines the program and further specifies the roles of tutors, mentors, and
peer coaches. It also details the expectations we have for the students.

# 6. Declaration

[↑Return to top](./#toc)

The peer coaches need to declare their hours via Topselect.

In total each peer coach can declare a **hard maximum** of 22 hours.

You can **only declare hours according to the following schema**:

-   4 hours: Training 1 + Tutor meets peer coach$^\dagger$
-   4 hours: LaTeX workshop + preparation
-   4 hours: Github workshop + preparation
-   6 hours: Training 2 + Tutor meets peer coach + Social activity$^\dagger$
-   4 hours: Track workshop + preparation
-   $\sum$ 22 hours

You can declare the hours only **after** the relevant event has taken place.

**Important**: When declaring hours, use the following schema:

> KI peercoaching, \<event name\>, \<date\>, J. Korbmacher

So, for example, for the first training you can declare as follows:

> KI Peercoaching, Training 1, 28/08/2024, J. Korbmacher

**If your declaration doesn't look like this, we have to reject it and you have
to redo it.**

† You can only declare 4+ hours at a time, meaning you can't declare the tutor
meets peer coach hours separately. This is why you declare them together with
the trainings.

The expenses for the social activity is declared differently. More on that later.
