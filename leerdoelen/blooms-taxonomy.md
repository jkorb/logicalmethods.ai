## Bloom's Taxonomy

For the analysis of these *leerdoelen*, I use *Bloom's Taxonomy* (Bloom, Benjamin Samuel. *Taxonomy Of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals*, 1961). According to this taxonomy, educational goals can be categorized into six levels: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.

*Knowledge*  
The first level, knowledge, is meant to remember the relevant knowledge and to retrieve this from long-term memory. A student determines the meaning of key concepts and how they relate to each other. The student should remember and reproduce the learned information, concepts or procedures. The student recognizes and/or remembers information, without direct comprehension of the concept's meaning or its applications. Without the ability to remember key concepts, it is impossible to understand or apply information afterwards. Recognizing and recalling are central.

*Comprehension*  
Second, understanding or comprehension of information focuses on the construction of a cognitive model in which the meaning of information is constructed. The student is able to formulate and explain the concepts in his own words, come up with own examples, can distinguish counter-examples, and can recognize causal relations. At this level, the student gains insight to connect new information with knowledge he already has. This includes interpretation, exemplification, classification, summarization, inference, comparison and explanation.

*Application*  
The level of application concerns application of abstract concepts, procedures or principles in concrete, new situations. This requires the understanding of the concept as well as the ability to choose which knowledge is relevant and how it is useful for a specific case. Application corresponds with “transformation”: the transfer of learning from one context to another. Central parts are execution and implementation.

*Analysis*  
The analyze-level consists of the distinction of information in separated parts, the research of relations between the parts and the understanding of the underlying structures. The student learns to distinguish the parts and discovers how the parts function together as a whole. This is pattern analysis: breaking down complex information into manageable units to uncover hidden relationships.

*Synthesis*  
The next level is the one of evaluation. The student weighs alternatives against one another using explicit criteria and standards. This means that one does not merely observe or analyze, but also judges the quality, validity, or applicability of those alternatives. This engages meta-cognitive skills, in which the student reflects on their own thought processes and, on that basis, forms a defensible judgment.

*Creation*  
Last but not least, at the level of creation the student combines elements and insights from earlier levels to construct something entirely new. This may involve formulating new hypotheses from multiple sources, producing an original design, or developing an innovative argument. This level brings together both convergent and divergent thinking processes: synthesizing various ideas and generating new possibilities.


### Taxonomy per leerdoel
The following tabular provides an overview of the *Leerdoelen* related to Bloom's taxonomy.

| **Bloom's Taxonomy** | LD 1 | LD 2 | LD 3 | LD 4 |
|----------------------|------|------|------|------|
| Knowledge            | +    | +    | +    | -    |
| Comprehension        | +    | +    | +    | -    |
| Application          | -    | -    | +    | +    |
| Analysis             | -    | +    | -    | -    |
| Synthesis            | -    | +    | -    | +    |
| Creation             | -    | -    | -    | -    |

The first *leerdoel*, regarding an overview of logical methods used in AI, is at the level of knowledge and comprehension. First, a broad overview directly requires recall and recognition of various logical methods. It presupposes that students must retrieve stored information about different logical systems and approaches. In addition, to construct an overview, students must not only know what each method is, but also understand how they differ and relate to each other, which is an act of conceptual integration. It requires recognizing categories and explaining features, which are comprehension-level tasks.

On the other hand, the first *leerdoel* is not at the level of application, since this objective does not ask students to use the methods to solve problems or apply them to new contexts. It remains at the level of knowing about methods rather than doing something with them. Moreover, the analysis level is absent, because there is no requirement to break down the logical methods or examine their internal structure. The learning goal is synthetic rather than analytic. Either synthesis and creation are not present. Indeed, the overview is descriptive rather than judgmental. Students are not asked to compare or evaluate methods on the basis of criteria. And students are not expected to construct new methods or ideas.

The second *leerdoel*, regarding the understanding how and why logical methods work, focuses on the knowledge, comprehension, analysis and synthesis level. To begin with, understanding presupposes prior factual knowledge of the methods in question. Students must have access to information about the mechanics and assumptions of various techniques. Second, the keyword "begrijpen" indicates the comprehension level directly. Students are being asked to form logical models of why methods work, involving interpretation and explanation in their own terms. Moreover, this learning goal is at the level of analysis, because to understand how and why a method works and what its limitations are requires dissecting its logical structure. This is analytical: examining mechanisms, assumptions, and possible failure modes. Last but not least, the synthesis level is visible in the fact that discussing limitations inherently involves evaluating the method against some standard (e.g., generalization, consistency, completeness). This introduces an evaluative judgment, aligned with synthesis in Bloom's taxonomy.

However, the second *leerdoel* doesn't focus on the level of application and creation. While understanding is a precondition for application, this goal stops short of asking students to actually apply logical methods to new problems. Secondly, although students reflect on how methods work, they are not expected to construct alternatives or develop new models.

The third *leerdoel*, regarding applying logical methods in domains of AI, calls for a knowledge, comprehension and application level. Firstly, to apply a method, one must first know what it is: its steps, definitions, and assumptions. This background knowledge is required for further steps of understanding. Next to that, application requires understanding both the method itself and the context in which it is to be applied. This presupposes the ability to interpret both. As a result, the level of application is the central intent of the learning goal: to take abstract methods and use them in new, concrete cases.

The third *leerdoel* misses the levels of analysis, synthesis and creation. There is no explicit call to decompose problems or methods into parts, nor to identify logical inter-dependencies. Therefore, analysis is not necessary. Furthermore, students are not asked to weigh alternatives or make normative judgments. The focus is on execution, not evaluation. Besides, the goal does not require developing new approaches or original extensions. The use is within established methods and known contexts.

The fourth and final *leerdoel*, regarding skills to evaluate inferences, focuses on the application and synthesis level of Bloom's taxonomy. Firstly, students should use logical tools to assess inference quality. This is a functional task: applying rules to cases. Secondly, the core activity here is evaluation: students are asked to judge the validity of inferences, which entails applying criteria and making determinations.

By contract, the levels of knowledge, comprehension, analysis and creation are not central in this fourth *leerdoel*. This learning goal frames logic as a skill. It focuses on procedural fluency, not declarative memory. While comprehension likely plays a role, it is not the most prominent part of the learning goal. Finally, no requirement to formulate new arguments, design logical systems, or invent inference strategies. The activity is assessive, not generative.

In conclusion, most *leerdoelen* concern the level of knowledge and comprehension. Some are either at the level of application or analysis or synthesis. However, none of the learning goals focus on the creation level. Though this learning could be visible in the chapters, it is not prominent in the learning goals.
