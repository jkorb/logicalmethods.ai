# Plan for chapters

## Plan for Chapter 1: Logic and AI

During the lecture(s) an introduction to the course is provided and all important concepts of the chapter are discussed. Students should study the textbook at home and prepare the workgroups by making some exercises.

### Self study

1. Read textbook, chapter 1, *Logic and AI*, and do the following exercises:
2. Exercise 1, *Test your knowledge*: these are multiple choice questions to test whether the student understands some key concepts.
3. Exercise 3, *Examples of indicators*: students should come up with own examples of indicators.
4. Exercise 4, *Recognizing indicators*: students should recognize the indicators.
5. Exercise 5, *Inferences*: students determine the premises and conclusion of an inference.
6. All multiple choice questions “test your knowledge” of the quizzes section.

### Workgroup

**Central leerdoel**: Een breed overzicht krijgen van de logische methoden die worden gebruikt in AI-onderzoek.

1. Are there any questions about the textbook chapter, the lecture or made exercises?
2. Short explanation of inferences, indicators, symbolic versus subsymbolic, system 1 and 2, and other concepts if necessary.
3. Discussion of the following exercises:  
   - Exercise 6, *Symbolic or subsymbolic*: let the students discuss the cases in groups. Then, discuss the correct answers classical.  
   - Exercise 7, *Thinking, fast and slow*: let the students discuss examples in groups. Then, let each group present their examples and discuss together whether the examples are correct.  
   - Exercise 9, *Discussion*: first in groups and then together.
4. Time for more questions

### Second self study

After the workgroup student should do:

1. Exercise 7, *Research*
2. All multiple choice questions of self study in quizzes section


## Plan for Chapter 2: Valid inference

## Plan for this chapter

During the lecture(s) an introduction to the course is provided and all important concepts of the chapter are discussed. Students should study the textbook at home and prepare the workgroups by making some exercises.

### Self study

1. Read textbook, chapter 2, *Valid inferences*, and do the following exercises:
2. All multiple choice “test your knowledge” questions.
3. Exercise 1, *Deduction and induction*: students should come up with own examples of deductive and inductive inferences.
4. Exercise 4, *Semantic tools*: students should remember the semantic tools discussed in the chapter.
5. Exercise 5, *Inferences*: students determine the premises and conclusion of an inference.

### Workgroup

**Central goal**: application and analysis of inferences and validity.

1. Are there any questions about the textbook chapter, the lecture or made exercises?
2. Short explanation of inferences, validity, induction, deduction and semantics
3. Discussion of the following exercises:
   - Exercise 2, *Monotonicity*: let the students discuss the cases in groups. Then, discuss the correct answers classical.
   - Exercise 4, *Malfunctioning*: let the students discuss the cases in groups. Then, discuss in class.
   - Exercise 8, *Discussion*: first in groups and then together.
   - Time for more questions

### Second self study

Students should do some more work after the workgroup.

1. Exercise 3, *Validity*
2. Exercise 7, *Research*
3. All multiple choice questions for self study
