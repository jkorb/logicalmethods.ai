<p>Like much of logic, formal languages have a <em>long</em> history.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The use of
abstract sentence letters as in $$A\text{ and }B$$ to express logical form can
already be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organon"
  target="_blank">Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Organon</em></a>. Leibniz&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica_universalis"
  target="_blank">characteristica
universalis</a> is
perhaps the first attempt at defining a formal language in the modern sense. In
mathematics, the rise of formal languages is associated with rise of logical
rigor in the foundations of mathematics, culminating in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logicism"
  target="_blank">logicist</a> projects, such as Gottlob
Frege&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begriffsschrift"
  target="_blank">Begriffsschrift</a>.</p>
<p>In logical theory, the main role of formal languages is to provide a model of
<strong>logical form</strong>. Remember from 


<a href="https://logicalmethods.ai/textbook/valid-inference//#formalization"
   
   
   
   
   
   >
Chapter 2. Valid inference</a>

 that validity doesn&rsquo;t depend on
the concrete words or sentences involved. <em>All</em> of the below inferences are
valid:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_%28language_model%29"
  target="_blank">BERT</a> is either my
favorite dog or an LLM, and BERT not an LLM. So, BERT is my favorite dog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that Ada is either on the Philosopher’s Walk or in the study, and she’s
not in the study, she therefore must be on the Philosopher’s Walk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either Johannes or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_%28Star_Trek%29"
  target="_blank">Data</a> is
teaching this class and Data is not teaching it. So, Johannes is teaching the
class.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to recognize the pattern and generate more examples of valid
inferences like this. If we let $A$ and $B$ be arbitrary sentences, then the
pattern is $$A\text{ or }B, \text{ not B}\vDash A.$$
This is the logical form of inferences 1.-3., which, by the way, is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_syllogism"
  target="_blank">disjunctive syllogism</a>.</p>
<p>From this perspective, formal languages are the result of introducing
<em>placeholders</em> for the logically irrelevant parts of language and special
symbols, so-called <strong>logical constants</strong> for the logically relevant parts of
language.</p>
<p>In the case of disjunctive syllogism, for example, the relevant formal language
will use so-called <strong>sentence letters</strong> ($p,q,r,\dots$) to stand for arbitrary
sentences, and <strong>propositional connectives</strong> for the logically relevant
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_%28grammar%29"
  target="_blank">grammatical conjunctions</a>
($\neg$ for &ldquo;not&rdquo;, $\land$ for &ldquo;and&rdquo;, $\lor$ for &ldquo;or&rdquo;, $\to$ for &ldquo;if &hellip;, then
&hellip;&rdquo;, &hellip;). We get something like this $$p\lor q,\neg p\vDash q$$ as the model
for the shared logical form of inferences 1.-3. The resulting <a href="/textbook/logic-and-ai/#logical-systems">logical
system</a>, known as <strong>propositional
logic</strong>, then, investigates the validity of these <em>formal</em> inferences.</p>
<p>Note that what&rsquo;s happening here is very much in line with the picture from 


<a href="https://logicalmethods.ai/textbook/logic-and-ai//#logical-systems"
   
   
   
   
   
   >
Chapter 1. Logic and AI</a>

, where we described logical systems
as <em>mathematical models</em> of valid inference. Mathematical models, remember, are
characterized by abstraction, idealization, and assumptions. Here it is easy to
see, for example, where the abstraction lies: we&rsquo;re abstracting away from
logically irrelevant features of language, such as which concrete sentence is
involved. A good example of idealization is that we&rsquo;re writing a single logical
constant, e.g. $\land$, for the many different ways to express conjunction in
natural language: &ldquo;and&rdquo;, &ldquo;as well as&rdquo;, &ldquo;together with&rdquo;, &hellip;</p>
<p>From the perspective of logical theory, the main advantage of developing
mathematical models of language and, more concretely, logical form is that it
allows us to investigate valid inference with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigour#Mathematics"
  target="_blank"><strong>mathematical
rigor</strong></a>, permitting us to
establish (meta-)logical facts <em>beyond any reasonable doubt</em>. But in this
course, we take a slightly more pragmatic perspective at formal languages as a
<strong>logical tool</strong>.</p>
<p>For us, formal languages <strong>solve a fundamental problem</strong> for AI: <em>How can we
store knowledge in such a way that we can communicate it to computational models
of intelligent behavior (computers)?</em> Formal languages solve this problem
because given their deterministic, mathematical nature, it is relatively easy to
teach them to computers. In fact, a fundamental insight from computer science is
that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language"
  target="_blank">programming
langauges</a> are, for all
intents and purposes, formal languages.</p>
<p>Moreover, for us as students of AI, it is important to note that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Database_languages"
  target="_blank">database
languages</a>, which are
used to create and search databases, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_language"
  target="_blank">ontology
languages</a>, which are used to
create representations of factual knowledge of the world, and so on <em>all are</em>
formal languages. In short, in knowledge representation, logical methods reign
supreme.</p>

<p>Before we can go ahead and give the mathematical definition of what a formal
language is, we need to talk a bit more about <em>sets</em>. Formal languages <em>are</em>
sets. So, we need to know what a set is before we can talk about formal
languages.</p>
<p>In 


<a href="https://logicalmethods.ai/textbook/valid-inference//#semantic-methods-for-deduction"
   
   
   
   
   
   >
2.3.1 </a>

, you first encountered sets. We now delve a bit
more into <strong>elementary set theory</strong>, the basic theory of sets.</p>
<p>A <em>set</em> is a collection of objects, called its <strong>elements</strong> or <strong>members</strong>. The
elements of a set are also said to <em>belong to</em> the set or to <em>be contained in</em>
the set. A set may contain any kind of objects whatsoever: numbers, symbols,
people, or even other sets. For $X$ a set and $x$ an object, we write $$x\in X$$
to say that $x$ is an element of $X$ and we write $$x \notin X$$ to say that $x$
is <em>not</em> an element of $X$. If we have many objects $x_1, \mathellipsis, x_n$,
then we also write $x_1, \mathellipsis, x_n\in X$ to say that $x_1\in X$, and
&hellip;, and $x_n\in X$.</p>
<p>If the elements of a set are precisely $a_1, \mathellipsis, a_n$, then we can
denote the set by $$\Set{a_1, \mathellipsis, a_n}.$$ This is called an
<strong>extensional definition</strong> of the set. So, the set $\Set{1,a,
\Set{\text{Robbie},0}}$, for example, contains precisely the number 1, the
symbol $a$, and the set $\Set{\text{Robbie},0}$, which in turn contains Robbie and
the number 0 as elements.</p>
<p>If the elements of a set are precisely the objects satisfying condition $\Phi$,
then we can denote the set by $$\Set{x:\Phi(x)}.$$ This is called a definition
by <strong>set abstraction</strong>. For example, $\Set{x:x\text{ is a prime number}}$ is the
set that contains all and only the prime numbers. So we have that $$3\in
\Set{x:x\text{ is a prime number}}$$ but $$4\notin \Set{x:x\text{ is a prime
number}}.$$</p>
<p>Formal languages are sets of elements, which are called <strong>formulas</strong>. We usually
denote formulas by uppercase letters $A,B,C,\dots$ or lowercase Greek letters
$\phi,\psi,\theta,\dots$. In general, a formal language $\mathcal{L}$ is defined
by two things: an <strong>alphabet</strong>, which contains the symbols the
$\mathcal{L}$-formulas are built up from, and a <strong>grammar</strong>, which says <em>how</em>
the formulas are to be constructed. Let&rsquo;s discuss the two in turn.</p>

<hr>

<p>Formulas are sequences of symbols, which are recruited from an alphabet. We
usually write $\Sigma$ to denote the alphabet of a language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the alphabet can be <em>any</em> set. So, e.g.,</p>
<p>$$\Sigma=\Set{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}$$</p>
<p>is a perfectly fine alphabet. You can use it to define the language for all the
numbers.</p>
<p>There is not so much more to be said about the alphabet but it&rsquo;s useful to
remark that in logical contexts, there are some special kinds of symbols that
are usually used in the alphabets, which have special meanings.</p>
<p>Here is a (non-exhaustive) list. Typically, we distinguish between:</p>
<p><strong>Non-logical symbols</strong></p>
<p>These symbols are typically the result of logical abstraction. But in knowledge
representation contexts, they can also be the result of representing
extra-logical information.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Propositional variables</strong> also known as <strong>sentence letters</strong>.</p>
<p>These stand for sentences, like &ldquo;it is raining&rdquo; or &ldquo;logic is awesome&rdquo;. When
it doesn&rsquo;t matter which sentences we&rsquo;re talking about, they are often
$p,q,r,\dots$. In knowledge representation (KR) contexts, they can also be
mnemonic, like $RAIN$ or $AWESOME$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Constants</strong>.</p>
<p>These stand for proper names, like &ldquo;Alan&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ada&rdquo;. In logic, they are often
$a,b,c,\dots$, but in KR-contexts, they can also be mnemonic, like $alan$ or
$ada$. Sometimes, they are just ordinary numerals, like $0,1,2,\dots$ or
$\pi$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Function symbols</strong>.</p>
<p>These stand for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28mathematics%29"
  target="_blank">functional
expressions</a>, like &ldquo;+&rdquo;
or &ldquo;the father of&rdquo;. In logic, often $f,g,h,\dots$ and in KR often mnemonic,
like $FatherOf$. In mathematical logic, function symbols like $+,-,\cdot,
\dots$ are common, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Predicates</strong>.</p>
<p>They stand for &hellip;
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_%28grammar%29https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_%28grammar%29"
  target="_blank">predicates</a>,
which are expressions that define properties or relationships, like &ldquo;being
blue&rdquo; or &ldquo;being greater than&rdquo;. In logic, usually $P,Q,R,\dots$ and in KR,
also mnemonics, like $BLUE$ or $GREATER$.</p>
<p>A special case is the identity symbol $=$, which some logicians treat as
logical and some as non-logical. Otherwise, it works just like predicate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: Function symbols and predicates come with an <em>arity</em>, which is how many
arguments they take. In syntax specifications, we often write this as a
superscript. So, for example, the fact that $BLUE$ applies to one thing (it&rsquo;s
<em>unary</em>) would be written $BLUE^1$.</p>
<p><strong>Logical symbols</strong></p>
<p>These are the result of idealization. Which logical symbols are available
depends on the logical system. There symbols for <em>many</em> logically relevant
concepts.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p><strong>Variables</strong>.</p>
<p>These stand for arbitrary but concrete individuals or properties. They have
a mainly logical function in the context of quantification, which we&rsquo;ll
cover more extensively later in the book.</p>
<p>They are typically $x,y,z,\dots$ but sometimes $\alpha,\beta,\delta$, when
we&rsquo;re talking about individuals. And they are typically $X,Y,Z,\dots$ when
we&rsquo;re talking about variables for properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sentential operators</strong>.</p>
<p>These connect one or more sentences or phrases to form a new one. Typical
examples are the <strong>classical propositional connectives</strong>:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th><strong>Symbol</strong></th>
          <th> </th>
          <th><strong>Meaning</strong></th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>$\neg,\sim$</td>
          <td></td>
          <td>not</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>$\land,\&amp;$</td>
          <td></td>
          <td>and</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>$\lor$</td>
          <td></td>
          <td>or</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>$\to,\Rightarrow,\supset$</td>
          <td></td>

      <tr>
          <td>$\vdots$</td>
          <td></td>
          <td>$\vdots$</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>But many other operators are known and/or can be introduced:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th><strong>Symbol</strong></th>
          <th>  </th>
          <th><strong>Meaning</strong></th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>$\square,\lozenge$</td>
          <td></td>
          <td>necessity, possibility</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>$K,B$</td>
          <td></td>
          <td>knowledge, belief</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>$G,F,H,P$</td>
          <td></td>
          <td>past, future</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>$P,O$</td>

      </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>Unfortunately, we won&rsquo;t be able to cover most of these more advanced
operators in detail.</p>
<p>The operators listed above are standard <em>logical</em> operators. But note that
in programming languages, for example, we often have mnemonic conditionals,
like in the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode"
  target="_blank">pseudocode</a>, for example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  IF ... THEN
      ...
  ELSE
      ...
  END IF
</code></pre><p>Similarly, programming languages often have idiosyncratic notation for the
classical propositional connectives (which are, of course, easier to type on
ordinary keyboards), such as $||$ for disjunction, $\&amp;\&amp;$ for conjunction
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29"
  target="_blank">C</a>, or simply
$\mathsf{and}$, $\mathsf{or}$, $\mathsf{not}$ in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29"
  target="_blank">Pyton</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quantifiers</strong>.</p>
<p>These allow us to express claims about all ($\forall$) or some ($\exists$)
things. More generally, quantifiers allow us to make <em>generalizations</em>.
There are also specialized quantifiers, such as numeric quantifiers, like
$\exists_3$ which says &ldquo;there are exactly 3&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Auxiliaries</strong>.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<p><strong>Parsing</strong></p>
<p>These are symbols that help the notation of the language. They are things
like commas &ldquo;,&rdquo; or parentheses &ldquo;(&rdquo; and &ldquo;)&rdquo;. They don&rsquo;t have a meaning
themselves, but they help us to disambiguate formulas. They are important
for parsing (see below).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are, in any case, only examples of some common symbols in the alphabets of
formal languages. Ultimately, the sky is the limit.</p>
<p>The formulas, then, are sequences of symbols from the alphabet. But not every
sequence of symbols is a formula, formulas are constructed from the symbols
according to <em>rules</em>.</p>

<p>The grammar of a language determines which strings of symbols from $\Sigma$ are
valid expressions of the language.</p>
<p>In the case of most formal languages in logic, grammars use a technique known as
<strong>inductive definition</strong>, which works as follows:</p>
<p>Our aim is to define the set $\mathcal{L}$ of <strong>(well-formed) formulas</strong>. We do
this by specifying in a first step a set of <strong>atomic formulas</strong>, which are not
themselves constructed. And then, in a second step, giving a set of
<strong>construction rules</strong>, which tell us how to construct new formulas from old
ones.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how this works for a standard language in propositional logic, where $\Sigma$ contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$p_1,\dots, p_n$ ($n$ propositional variables)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$\neg,\land,\lor,\to,\leftrightarrow$ (the propositional operators), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$(,)$ (the auxiliaries).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We then say that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$p_1,\dots, p_n \in \mathcal{L}$ and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if $A\in\mathcal{L}$, then $\neg A\in \mathcal{L}$ as well as</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if $A,B\in\mathcal{L}$, then $(A\land B),(A\lor B),(A\to B),(A\leftrightarrow
B)\in \mathcal{L}$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The crux of the definition is the implicit assumption that <em>nothing else is a
formula</em>. This &ldquo;closure condition&rdquo; guarantees that $\mathcal{L}$ is a
well-defined set, where for each sequence of symbols from $\Sigma$, we can
determine whether it&rsquo;s in $\mathcal{L}$ or not.</p>
<p>For example, we can easily see that $$(A\lor (B\leftrightarrow \neg A))$$ is a
member of $\mathcal{L}$. To see this, we simply perform the construction:</p>
<ul>
<li>We know that $A$ is a formula.</li>
<li>So we know that $\neg A$ is a formula.</li>
<li>We also know that $B$ is a formula.</li>
<li>So we know that $(B\leftrightarrow \neg A)$ is a formula.</li>
<li>So, finally, we know that $(A\lor (B\leftrightarrow \neg A))$ is a formula.</li>
</ul>
<p>But we can also see that $\neg A\neg$ is not a formula, since no rule every
allows for $\neg$ to occur in a formula without being followed by formula.</p>
<p>In computer science and AI, there is a wide-spread notation that significantly
simplifies the above rules: the so-called <strong>Backus-Naur Form (BNF)</strong>. In BNF,
instead of all of the above, we can simply write:</p>
<p>$$A::= p_i\mid\neg A\mid (A\land A)\mid (A\lor A)\mid (A\to A)\mid (A\leftrightarrow A)$$</p>
<p>Here, we read the &ldquo;$\mid$&rdquo; as an &ldquo;or&rdquo;. And so this reads: a formula is either a
propositional variable, or the negation of a formula, or the conjunction of two
formulas, or &hellip;.</p>
<p>You should know that BNFs sometimes take different forms. Here is an equivalent
way of giving the BNF for the same language:</p>
<p>$$\langle prop\rangle\mapsto p_1\mid \dots\mid p_n$$</p>
<p>$$\langle fml\rangle\mapsto\langle prop\rangle\mid\neg\langle fml\rangle\mid
(\langle fml\rangle\land \langle fml\rangle)\mid (\langle fml\rangle\lor
\langle fml\rangle)\mid $$
$$(\langle fml\rangle\to \langle fml\rangle)\mid (\langle
fml\rangle\leftrightarrow \langle fml\rangle)$$</p>
<p>but these are just
notational differences.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form"
  target="_blank">BNFs</a> are a <strong>powerful
method for defining formal languages</strong>. They are frequently used in logic,
computer science, and AI. For example, the syntax of most programming languages
is defined in BNF, see, e.g.,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html"
  target="_blank">Python</a>. Even if you want to
know what a valid email really is, you need to look up <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322"
  target="_blank">its
BNF</a>.</p>
<p>The formal languages we use in logic and KR are usually rather simple in that
they allow for uncomplicated grammars. The complex grammatical phenomena we
often encounter in natural languages, for example, which are required for to
capture all linguistic nuances (which are often <em>logically</em> irrelevant), we need
more sophisticated grammas, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-sensitive_grammar"
  target="_blank">context-sensitive
grammars</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here are some standard logical languages, which will frequently occur in the
book:</p>
<p><strong>Propositional logic</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen the simple BNF for this:</p>
<p>$$A::= p_i\mid\neg A\mid (A\land A)\mid (A\lor A)\mid (A\to A)\mid (A\leftrightarrow A)$$</p>
<p>This works with
$\Sigma=\Set{p_1,\dots,p_n,\neg,\land,\lor,\to,\leftrightarrow,(,)}$</p>
<p>Some remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Depending on the choice of propositional variables, there are many <em>different</em>
propositional languages. It&rsquo;s always important to exactly specify what your
propositional variables are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, we only use a subset of the operators. E.g. the language:</p>
<p>$$A::= p_i\mid\neg A\mid (A\land A)$$</p>
<p>It turns out that this language is equally <strong>expressive</strong> as the language
above: everything that can be said using propositional variables and
$\neg,\land,\lor,\to,\leftrightarrow$ can also be said using just
$\neg,\land$. Seeing why is a topic for later in the course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Translating natural language expressions into a formal language expression is
a process known as <strong>formalization</strong>. It&rsquo;s not always easy, but here are some
examples for formalization with propositional languages:</p>
<hr>
<p>The letter isn&rsquo;t in the left drawer                                         $\leadsto$            $\neg p$</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the case that the letter is in the left drawer                     $\leadsto$            $\neg p$</p>
<p>The letter is in the left and in the right drawer                           $\leadsto$            $(p\land q)$</p>
<p>The letter is not in the left drawer, but it&rsquo;s also not in the right one    $\leadsto$     $(\neg p\land \neg q)$</p>
<p>The letter is in the left or in the right drawer                            $\leadsto$           $(p\lor q)$</p>
<p>The letter is neither in the left nor in the right drawer                   $\leadsto$     $(\neg p\land \neg q)$</p>
<p>If the letter is in the left drawer, then it&rsquo;s not in the right drawer      $\leadsto$         $(p\to \neg q)$</p>
<p>The letter is in the left drawer, if it&rsquo;s not in the right one              $\leadsto$         $(\neg q\to p)$</p>
<p>The letter is only in the left drawer, if it&rsquo;s not in the right one         $\leadsto$         $(p\to \neg q)$</p>
<p>The letter is in the left drawer just in case it&rsquo;s not in the right one     $\leadsto$   $(p\leftrightarrow \neg q)$</p>
<hr>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>First-order logic</strong></p>
<p><strong>First-order logic (FOL)</strong> is extremely important in logical theory and in AI
applications. In part, this is because FOL has a lot of <strong>expressive power</strong>: a
lot of
claims—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_%28computer_scientist%29"
  target="_blank">some</a>
would say <em>everything</em>—can be formalized in it.</p>
<p>In general, the alphabet looks something like this:</p>
<p>$$\Set{a,b,c,\dots,
x,y,z,\dots,f,g,h,\dots,P,Q,R,\dots,\neg,\land,\lor,\to,\leftrightarrow,\forall,\exists,(,),,}$$</p>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: There&rsquo;s no typo at the end here 😃 The last symbol is a literal comma.</p>
<p>For a concrete language, we&rsquo;d need to pick some suitable constants
$a,b,c,\dots$, function symbols $f,g,h,\dots$, and predicates $P,Q,R,\dots$.
Usually, in KR-contexts, these will be mnemonic, of course.</p>
<p>The full syntax of FOL, then, is:</p>
<p>$$\langle const\rangle ::= a \mid b\mid \dots $$
$$\langle var\rangle ::= x \mid y\mid \dots $$
$$\langle unop\rangle ::= \neg$$
$$\langle binop\rangle ::= \land\mid\lor\mid\to\mid\leftrightarrow$$
$$\langle quant\rangle ::= \forall\mid\exists$$
$$\langle fu n^n\rangle ::= f^n\mid g^n\mid \dots $$
$$\langle term\rangle::= \langle const\rangle\mid\langle variable\rangle\mid
\langle fun^n\rangle(\overbrace{\langle term\rangle,\dots,\langle term\rangle}^{n\text{ times}})$$
$$\langle pred^n\rangle ::= P^n\mid Q^n\mid \dots $$
$$\langle atom\rangle::= \langle pred^n\rangle(\underbrace{\langle term\rangle,\dots\langle term\rangle}_{n\text{ times}})$$
$$\langle fml\rangle::=\langle atom\rangle\mid\langle unop\rangle\langle fml\rangle\mid
(\langle fml\rangle\langle binop\rangle \langle fml\rangle)\mid \langle quant\rangle \langle
var\rangle\langle fml\rangle$$</p>
<p>As you can see, the syntax of FOL is significantly more complex than the syntax
of propositional logic. But syntactically, nothing too complicated is going on.
Assuming, for example, that $FRIEND$ is a binary predicate and $data$ a constant
for data in our language, we can write:</p>
<p>$$\exists xFRIEND(data,x)$$</p>
<p>to say that Data has a friend.</p>
<p>Here are some more suggestions on how to formalize:</p>
<hr>
<p>Not everybody handsome is smart             $\leadsto$  $\neg\forall x(H(x)\to S(x))$</p>
<p>Everybody who&rsquo;s smart is handsome           $\leadsto$  $\forall x(S(x)\to H(x))$</p>
<p>A person who&rsquo;s smart is handsome            $\leadsto$  $\forall x(S(x)\to H(x))$</p>
<p>Someone who&rsquo;s smart is handsome             $\leadsto$  $\forall x(S(x)\to H(x))$</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s smart and handsome              $\leadsto$  $\forall x(S(x)\land H(x))$</p>
<p>Somebody who&rsquo;s smart exists                 $\leadsto$  $\exists x S(x)$</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s not smart            $\leadsto$  $\exists x\neg S(x)$</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s smart and somebody&rsquo;s handsome    $\leadsto$  $\exists xS(x)\land \exists xH(x)$</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s smart and handsome               $\leadsto$  $\exists x(S(x)\land H(x))$</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s both smart and handsome            $\leadsto$  $\neg\exists x(S(x)\land H(x))$</p>
<p>Somebody, who&rsquo;s smart, is handsome          $\leadsto$  $\exists x(S(x)\land H(x))$</p>
<hr>
<p>Indeterminate terms, like pronouns, indexicals, etc., are formalized using variables. Only when clearly the same thing is meant, use the same variable, if different things could be meant, use different variables:</p>
<hr>
<p>He&rsquo;s handsome                         $\leadsto$  $H(x)$</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s handsome and smart              $\leadsto$  $H(x)\land S(x)$</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s handsome and <em>he</em>&rsquo;s smart        $\leadsto$  $H(x)\land S(y)$</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s handsome and she&rsquo;s smart         $\leadsto$  $H(x)\land S(y)$</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a smart and handsome person    $\leadsto$  $H(x)\land S(x)$</p>
<hr>
<p>Most languages used for KR are <strong>fragments</strong> of FOL, since FOL has certain
theoretical limitations, which we&rsquo;ll discuss later in the course.</p>

<hr>

<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve looked at how to define formulas by looking at how they are
constructed from simpler formulas. Now, we&rsquo;ll invert the perspective and
<em>desconstruct</em> or <strong>parse</strong> formulas.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em> you ask? Well, the reason we need to look into this is because that&rsquo;s
essentially what computers do to <strong>understand formulas</strong>. The idea of parsing is
to split a formula according to the rules of the grammar to recover how it was
constructed.</p>
<p>An example shows this more clearly than words. This is the result of parsing the
propositional formula $((p\land(p\to q))\to\neg q)$:</p>


<img src="https://logicalmethods.ai/textbook/formal-languages/img/tree.png" class="img-thumbnail"  alt="parsing tree" >


<p>The result is what&rsquo;s known as a <strong>parsing tree</strong>, it is a useful representation
of the syntactic structure of a formula.</p>
<p>Here is an example from first-order logic:</p>


<img src="https://logicalmethods.ai/textbook/formal-languages/img/fo-tree.png" class="img-thumbnail"  alt="parsing tree" >


<p>The parsing tree of a formula essentially tells you, which rules have been
applied in which order to obtain the formula in question.</p>
<p>A fundamental insight of logical theory is that when a grammar is properly
defined, we get what&rsquo;s known as <strong>unique readability</strong>. Unique readability is of
the utmost importance since if it fails, this means that formulas are
<strong>ambiguous</strong>: they have two (or more) possible readings.</p>
<p>To understand the problem, consider the &ldquo;formula&rdquo; $p\land q\lor r$. Note that
this is not really a formula because of the missing parentheses (check the
rules). You could encounter this formula, for example, in a KR context, where
you represent breakfast options to a computer: $p$ stands for having granola,
$q$ stands for having tea, and $r$ stands for having coffee context. Now the way
the &ldquo;formula&rdquo; is written, there are two ways of parsing it:</p>


<img src="https://logicalmethods.ai/textbook/formal-languages/img/ambiguity.png" class="img-thumbnail"  alt="ambiguous" >


<p>These correspond to two readings:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can have eggs and either tea or coffee. $(p\land (q\lor r))$, the left
tree</li>
<li>You can have eggs and tea or just coffee. $((p\land q)\lor r))$, the right
tree</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, these are very different things and might lead to the terrible
consequence of not having anything to eat for breakfast.</p>
<p>This is why we need to be careful about the <strong>auxiliaries</strong>, like $(,)$, which
ultimately guarantee unique readability. So, we need to be careful.</p>
<p>Parsing is an incredibly important subject in the foundations and practice of
programming, natural language processing (NLP), and elsewhere. We don&rsquo;t have
time to go into the details, but think of programming for a second. A
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language"
  target="_blank">programming language</a> is
essentially a tool to write down instructions for a computer in a human-readable
way. What happens &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; is that the computer translates the program
you write into machine instructions (the proverbial 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s).</p>
<p>To ensure that the machine instructions really correspond to what you had in
mind when you wrote the program, the computer needs to understand <em>what you
meant</em>. Since a computer is deterministic and not <em>particularly</em> intelligent,
the only way it can do this is according to clear instructions about what means
what.</p>
<p>But clearly, we can&rsquo;t just write for each program what it means in machine
instructions-otherwise, what&rsquo;s the point of having the language in the first
place? Instead, we specify what the individual expressions of the language mean
and how combining them according to the grammar affects that meaning. In this
way, we guarantee that for each program we could possibly write, we can
translate it into machine instructions.</p>
<p>But to do so, we need to know which expressions occur in which order in the
program. To determine this is the role of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing#Parser"
  target="_blank">parser</a>. This shows the
fundamental importance of parsing in programming and human-computer interaction.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk for a moment about the role of formal languages in AI. We&rsquo;ve already
talked about the fact that programming languages are essentially just formal
languages. So we can use the theory of formal languages to understand this
aspect of human-machine interaction, which is crucial also in AI. Here are some
other applications:</p>

<p>One application of formula languages, parsing, and related techniques is in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing"
  target="_blank"><strong>natural language processing
(NLP)</strong></a>. For a long
time (until roughly the 1990s), formal languages played a key role in NLP in
what in analogy to symbolic AI is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing#Symbolic_NLP_%281950s_%E2%80%93_early_1990s%29"
  target="_blank">symbolic
NLP</a>.</p>
<p>As suggested by Wikipedia, we can use a famous thought experiment known as the
<em>Chinese room</em> to illustrate the idea:</p>
<p><div class="container " >
  <figure>
    <blockquote class="blockquote fs-6">
      <p>
      Imagine a native English speaker who knows no Chinese locked in a room full of boxes of Chinese symbols (a data base) together with a book of instructions for manipulating the symbols (the program). Imagine that people outside the room send in other Chinese symbols which, unknown to the person in the room, are questions in Chinese (the input). And imagine that by following the instructions in the program the man in the room is able to pass out Chinese symbols which are correct answers to the questions (the output). The program enables the person in the room to pass the Turing Test for understanding Chinese but he does not understand a word of Chinese.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <figcaption class="blockquote-footer text-end">
      Jon Searle. 1999. &#39;The Chinese Room&#39;
    </figcaption>
    
  </figure>
</div>

Essentially, the computer is the person in the room. The rules are parsing rules
and formal grammars, which enable the room to &ldquo;speak Chinese&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The idea was to build NLP technologies in a similar way and for a while this was
moderately successful. But much for the same reasons why symbolic AI in general
&ldquo;failedd&rdquo;, symbolic NLP is no longer a strong paradigm in NLP.  While symbolic
methods are still around, in NLP, statistical methods, which are at the core of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model"
  target="_blank">LLMs</a>, for example, rule
the waves.</p>

<p>Things are more interesting when it comes to KR. To this day, formal languages
and knowledge bases (KBs) are <strong>powerful tools</strong> when it comes to storing and
making accessible known facts to computational systems, such as computers or
AI-systems. Mathematically speaking, a knowledge bases is just a set of
formulas. In a slogan: $$\mathbf{KB}\subseteq \mathcal{L}$$</p>
<p>The main strengths of KBs is their <strong>reliability</strong> and <strong>precision</strong>. Mistakes
in KBs are essentially only due to human error. Interestingly, though, there is
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13578"
  target="_blank">ongoing research</a> on using LLMs, for example,
to store factual information, even though they can&rsquo;t compete with knowledge
bases yet.</p>
<p>What we should note, though, is that the formal languages that are used for KR
are usually <strong>less expressive</strong> than FOL. This is due to some theoretical
results about FOL, which provide fundamental roadblocks to using its full
expressive power in computational contexts. We&rsquo;ve already briefly touched upon
one such reason in 


<a href="https://logicalmethods.ai/textbook/logic-and-ai//#as-a-foundation"
   
   
   
   
   
   > Chapter 1. Logic and AI</a>

, when we
spoke about Turing&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_%28logic%29"
  target="_blank">undecidability
theorem</a>, which states
that validity checking in FOL, specifically, cannot be fully automated.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_logic"
  target="_blank">Description logic</a> is an
interesting example of an approach to KR that uses what&rsquo;s effectively a fragment
of FOL KR-purposes.</p>
<p>An active area of research is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web"
  target="_blank">semantic
web</a>, which uses languages like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language"
  target="_blank">OWL</a> to make data on the
internet machine readable.</p>
